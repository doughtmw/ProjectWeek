# SlicerAR

## Key Investigators

- Adam Rankin (Robarts Research Institute)
- Mitchell Doughty (Sunnybrook)

# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

## Objective

1. Enable video passthrough to OpenVR family of devices

## Approach and Plan
### Mitch's learning goals:
1. Learn about capabilities of the [SlicerVirtualReality](https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality) module and how to perform basic visualization/transformation tasks.
2. Streamline/optimize 3D model creation from manual/automated segmentation. 
3. Export 3D location information of imaging fiducials for use in marker registration.
4. [OpenIGTLink](https://github.com/openigtlink/OpenIGTLink) for communication with imaging devices, rendering in Slicer.
